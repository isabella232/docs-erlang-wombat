This documentation describes the WombatOAM tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

WombatOAM for PCF is an operations and maintenance (OAM) tool that runs in your PCF deployment to monitor and troubleshoot RabbitMQ and other Erlang and Elixir systems running on PCF. To learn how [WombatOAM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/products/wombat-oam.html) works, watch the [6-minute intro video](https://youtu.be/iweKeihJ5Qo).

WombatOAM performs two main functions:

- **Monitoring**: Monitors nodes, including collecting and displaying metrics, alarms and logs from the managed nodes. WombatOAM tools allow you to inspect and troubleshoot your system, as well as APIs that you can use to hook into your existing OAM and SaaS tools.
- **Orchestration**: Deploys nodes in the cloud or on specific proprietary clusters.

      <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Orchestration is currently in Beta. We are looking for users interested in working with us while we bring it to R1.</p>
